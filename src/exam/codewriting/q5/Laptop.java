	 * We wish to create a Laptop class.

	 * This can affect the state of the computer (whether it is asleep or not) as well as whether the button is able to be pressed. 
	 * Your Laptop class should include an instance variable to track whether the laptop is currently open or not.
	 * The beginnings of this class have been provided to you below. Examine the instructions and complete what remains.
